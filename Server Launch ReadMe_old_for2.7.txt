To launch all the servers in a single command prompt, use emulator.bat

otherwise you can launch the servers individually.

If you launch the servers individually there is a certain order to 3 servers

you must first do launch_directory.bat

then launch_csds.bat

after those 2 are launched in that order you can launch all the other servers in any order you want.

if you do not launch directoryserver first and csds second, your other servers will NOT show up in the server list for 30 minutes to an hour
