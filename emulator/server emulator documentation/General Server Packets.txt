QUERY: The query data to send to the server (byte size: variable).
QSize: The size of the query data (byte size: uint32).
Command: The command data to send to the server (byte size: pByte).
CSize: The size of the command data (byte size: uint32).
ReplySize: A variable to store the size of the reply data (byte size: variable, output parameter).
Returns:

The reply data received from the server. Returns NULL on failure.

Process:
